# API

**Using the API**

The API requires has 2 optional parameters, these are the `GET` parameters `s` and `h`.  

The `s` parameter refers to the `StartPoint` in the db. So, 0 would start from the first row in the DB, and 50 would start from the 50th row (from the beginning).

The `h` parameter is for a hash. Using this will remove the need for an `s` parameter.
