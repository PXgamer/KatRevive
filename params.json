By default, the username is *root* and the password is blank.  \r\nTo use this, copy it into a MySQL terminal instance, or copy it into PHPMyAdmin or your respective MySQL manager.  \r\n\r\n#### index.php\r\nThis is the root file, and the file that you will use to view torrents. You can access other torrents by using the `GET` parameter of `s`.  \r\nThis layout shows 5 columns.\r\n- Verified: Displayed as a star\r\n- Hash: The info hash for that specific torrent, this is unique in the db\r\n- Name: The name of the torrent\r\n- Category: What main category it was in on KAT, the DB also contains the `category_id` which allows for subcategories as well\r\n- URLs: The torrent file link, and the magnet link\r\n\r\n#### install.php\r\nThe installer file. Just run this, and select an import type.  \r\n*Please note, these will need to be downloaded beforehand and added to the `import_lists` folder.*  \r\n\r\nThere are 2 example [import files](https://github.com/PXgamer/KatRevive/tree/master/import_lists) with the same torrent, to demonstrate. The actual imports can be downloaded elsewhere.\r\n\r\nJust select the type you want to import, and hit the import button.\r\n\r\n#### import_db_list.php\r\nThis shouldn't be accessed from anywhere, it will automatically be called by using the `install.php` file.  \r\nPlease don't run this more than once, and please note that it **will** be slow when installing.\r\n\r\n#### api/index.php\r\nThe API, will create a JSON formatted array of torrents. Is limited to 20 at a time, and can be browsed using the `GET` parameter `s`.\r\n\r\n#### favicon.png\r\nJust ignore this, it's the favicon to load when using the site in a browser.\r\n\r\n#### funcs.php\r\nNo need to touch this file, unless changing the db details. It's self contained and used in the other files.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\nClone to your local or remote server using `git clone https://github.com/PXgamer/KatRevive.git`.  \r\n\r\nI have set this up to use MySQL with a username of `root` and no password. This can be changed in the `funcs.php` file.   \r\n\r\nNext, copy the code out of the `create_db.sql` file and run this in your MySQL administration tool. For example, in PHPMyAdmin, navigate to the SQL tab, and paste it there. Then run this. \r\n\r\nCopy your `hourlydump.txt` and/or `dailydump.txt` file(s) to the `import_lists` folder.  \r\n\r\nOpen the `install.php` file in a browser, and select the file you'd like to install. Then click `import`.  \r\n\r\nThis can take a while depending on the number of torrents your file contains, I tested with 3 Million+ torrents in the data dump I had, which took roughly 10 minutes.  \r\n\r\n## The Database/Table\r\nThe database is called `kat_db` by default and contains a single table `t_collection`. This table contains 10 columns, as follows:  \r\n- torrent_info_hash\r\n- torrent_name\r\n- torrent_category\r\n- torrent_info_url\r\n- torrent_download_url\r\n- size\r\n- category_id\r\n- files_count\r\n- upload_date\r\n- verified\r\n\r\n## Other Features\r\nThe API: https://github.com/PXgamer/KatRevive/tree/master/api  \r\nHash Searching: https://github.com/PXgamer/KatRevive/tree/master/hash  ",
