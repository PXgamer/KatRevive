# Main Search

## Using the search
The main search has 2 optional parameter, these are the `GET` parameters `q` (query) and `c` (category).

For example, you could search for `search/?q=Step&c=57` would show up `Stephen Colbert 2016 05 16 Jason Sudeikis 720p HDTV x264-CROOKS[rartv]`.

To use it, just do: search/?q=*Query*&c=*CategoryId*

I will be adding a dropdown to allow easy changing of the category asap (as most people don't know the category ids).
